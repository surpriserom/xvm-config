In game view of the spotted indicator for sixth sens, big enought to not be missed, a bit transparent so you still see behind.

per line, the number of shot on this tank, last damage(yellow), total damage, tank name, player name. A red cross when you killed it. | 

####Camera
I chose to use the last implemented function of the mode the camera mod, so it allow you to have higer zoom ( you see better, your russian tank don't aim better) and better  unzoom. kinda cool when your are dead to see from a higher point of view, but when your are in gale, it's not often youuse a big zoom or you unzoom much.

Zoom value are x2, x3, x4, x6, x8, x10, x16, x32. No more because x32 is already a bit too much.

In arcade mode view range defaul is 2 to 25, set in mod at 1 to 50 and post mortem 1 to 200. In strategic view (arty view) default is 40 to 100, set in mod at 5 to 200.
![Zoom view](https://github.com/surpriserom/xvm-config/blob/develop/surpriserom/Data/camera-zoom.jpg)
In this picture i use a 17pounder with 0.32 acruacy with a 100% trained crew and a vent, as you can see with a x32 zoom even a such acruate gun give a bigger aiming circlethan the tank.
